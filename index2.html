    <h1>Subtle Frequency Ratios</h1>
    <p>You might have heard that note frequencies that are an <b>octave apart</b> are
       related by a ratio of 2:1. In other words, a note that vibrates twice as fast as another
       is an octave higher. A vibration with a frequency of 220 times per second is sometimes called A3; 
       in turn a frequency of 440 times per second is sometimes called A4.
    </p>
    <p>
        What about other notes and intervals? If you compared the frequencies of the major third,
        what ratio would you find?
    </p>
    <p>Each of these audio files is the same, except that the second tone (the major third) is tuned slightly differently.</p>
    <p>
        How would you describe each clip? Does one sound more in tune than another? Does one sound less in tune?
